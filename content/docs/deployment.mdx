To share your Frame101 projects with the world — whether they're interactive lessons, admin tools, or full learning modules — it's important to ensure they are deployed in a clean, reliable, and scalable way.

This page contains notes and deployment suggestions. While I don't provide a full deployment tutorial here, the information below should help others successfully publish their own Frame101 projects.

## Focus on Design and Integration

To create experiences that enhance learning and usability:

- Use **user-centered design**
- Keep your layout **clear and consistent**
- Apply effective **color and typography**
- Ensure components integrate **seamlessly with Frame101**

If you're building for the Frame101 ecosystem or planning to share your tool, please review the [Contributor Design Guidelines](#) for expectations around accessibility and user flow.

## Recommended Deployment Platform: Vercel

Vercel is my **recommended platform for deploying full-stack Frame101 projects**. It supports both front-end and backend/serverless functionality and is especially well-suited for Vue.js, React, and Vite projects.

You can think of it like **Netflix for developers** — you push your code and it’s automatically deployed, fast and optimized.

### Why I Recommend Vercel:

- **Zero-config** setup (especially for Vite, Vue, and React)
- **Built-in backend support** via serverless functions
- **Global CDN** for fast delivery
- **Simple environment variable management**
- **Automatic deployments from GitHub**

> Other options like Netlify or Firebase can be used for static front-end projects, but they offer limited support for backend/serverless features compared to Vercel.

## Deployment Notes

Here are general notes for deploying Frame101-based projects (not step-by-step):

- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to make sure your project compiles locally
- If using Vite, ensure the output folder is `dist`
- Push your project to GitHub so it can be imported into Vercel
- In Vercel, configure:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Output directory: `dist`
  - Environment variables (e.g. `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_PUBLIC_KEY`)
- Vercel automatically sets up deployment previews for each push
- Backend routes (if present) can be created in `api/` using serverless functions

## Summary

- This doc provides **notes only**, not a step-by-step guide
- Use **Vercel** for best results, especially for full-stack or dynamic apps
- Netlify is okay for static-only projects
- Always test build locally before pushing
- Configure your `.env` files securely for both local and production environments
