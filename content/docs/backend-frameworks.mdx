## What Is a Backend Framework?

A backend framework runs on the server and handles core tasks such as:

- Managing routes and handling requests  
- Sending data to and from the frontend  
- Performing server-side logic  
- Controlling application flow behind the scenes

In this project, we use:

- **Node.js** – the runtime that executes JavaScript on the server  
- **Express.js** – a minimalist framework for routing and middleware

## Node.js

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser — perfect for server-side apps.

### Key Features

- Fast and event-driven
- Asynchronous and non-blocking
- Uses JavaScript everywhere (frontend + backend)
- Ideal for lightweight backend services

## Express.js

### What is Express?

Express.js is a **minimal web framework for Node.js** that makes it easy to define server routes and logic.

### Key Features

- Route-based architecture (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Support for middleware (e.g., logging, error handling)
- Easily connects to frontend via JSON APIs
- Simple syntax, fast to set up

## Implementation Notes

- The backend is powered by **Node.js** with **Express.js** for routing
- Routes are created for key endpoints (e.g., `/api/lessons`)
- Middleware is used to handle logging, parsing, and error handling
- Project structure separates routes, controllers, and configuration files
