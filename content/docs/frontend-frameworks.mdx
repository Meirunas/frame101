## What Is a Frontend Framework?

Frontend frameworks help developers build interactive user interfaces efficiently. They handle:
- DOM rendering and updates
- Component architecture
- Routing (single-page navigation)
- State management

In this project, we focus on three major frameworks:

---

## React

React is a component-based JavaScript library developed by Facebook.

**Key Features:**
- JSX syntax
- Virtual DOM for performance
- Component state and props
- Strong ecosystem (hooks, context, etc.)

[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

---

## Vue.js

Vue is a progressive framework focused on simplicity and flexibility.

**Key Features:**
- Easy learning curve
- Single-file components (`.vue`)
- Built-in directives and reactivity
- Vue Router and Pinia/Vuex for state

## Next.js

Next.js is a React-based framework that adds SSR and routing.

**Key Features:**
- File-based routing
- Server-side rendering (SSR) or static generation (SSG)
- Built-in API routes
- Great performance and SEO support

## UI Implementation Notes

- All frontend pages are styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Modular layout using components (Hero, Features, Cards, CTA)
- Responsive behavior tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Accessibility & UX

- Semantic HTML with landmarks (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Color contrast verified with Lighthouse and WAVE tools
- Focusable elements and keyboard navigation enabled
- Button components with `aria-label` support
